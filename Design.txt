5NF Goals


Total = Item.Cost + Feature(s).Cost + Tax.State [ Outlet.State ]
Emergent Items = Unique [ Item.Id and Item.Features ] string
Address Type = Customer if OutletId == null or Outlet if CustomerId is null
Outlet's Customers = Correlates with Order

Constraint
In Address, CustomerId and OutletId are not nullable via EF; exchange null for empty string

States with no tax rate require a multiply by zero check

Connection String

metadata=res://*/PizzaBoxDatabase.csdl|res://*/PizzaBoxDatabase.ssdl|res://*/PizzaBoxDatabase.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string="data source=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;initial catalog=model;integrated security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=EntityFramework"

Trouble(s) I ran Into:

Problem-1:

The dependency, "EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact.dll", was not present in the, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE", folder, luckuly I had a VS 2017 installation that had it in it, so I copied it over and it worked.

After I did the App.config for my class library was updated with the connection string, I may need that (may even need to modify that) in the settings.json file of the MVC Core project.

Note-1: May also want to make a copy of that .dll and store it in a USB for safe keeping.

Note-2: May be related to the, "EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact", NuGet package I had installed

Problem-2

Had to add the dropping of tables to the generated script

Note-1: Had to be sensitive to relational dependencies

Note-2: Same goes for foriegn keys

Problem-3

Had to swap out, "System.Data.Entity", and, "System.Entity.Infrastructure", with, "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore"
